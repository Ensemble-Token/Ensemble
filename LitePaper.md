Bitcoin, which is built on Blockchain, was an effort to save the “money” from the centralized, authoritative governments and institutions.
However, nowadays, cryptocurrencies are falling apart from their main purpose of saving the “money” and they are becoming more institutionalized while individuality is left behind. 

Ensemble token is created for each individual to have a say and to make a difference. 
Ensemble is created as a simple, undistinguished token; to be suitable for its purpose. 
The future of this token will be decided by the holders of this token. 
Ensemble is a collective token, of which it’s project and technology will be decided and developed by its holders and coders.

The mechanism of Ensemble token works in a way that as the project is improved by the holders and coders, their influence on the project will increase.

Lite paper, token and related projects will be improved and written by the holders. 
Ensemble is built on four pillars to provide an efficient system.

# ___________ENCOR___________

Encor is a platform based on open-source software and in which the open-source software coders are awarded.  
To provide a smooth process and to form a core community, initially joining the community will only be via a reference or an invitation. 
Coders are free to exhibit their projects in any language and any area of study in this platform. 
Other coders evaluate and interpret the project and they can comment on, provide suggestions for and promote these projects. 

Example: Any coder may revise an exhibited project; may correct an error or may make a suggestion.
These revisions are visible to everyone and are open to comments and votes.
However, unless the owner of the project chooses to make a change, revisions cannot be applied to the project.
If the owner of the project chooses to make change, they can add these revisions to their project just by one click or edit these revisions and add that edited version. 
The system of Encor will ameliorate the open-source softwares and new projects further ahead. 

Each like, comment and sharing on Encor has a point equivalent. 
ENS token will be given in accordance with the points earned. 
For each token given, equivalent amount of ENS will be burned.
Thus, as the project is improved, maximum supply of Ensamble will reduce and the value of Ensamble will increase. 

Ensemble is a token which will improve by the contributions of all. 
New tasks can be opened in line with the requirements or by the new decisions made on the voting platform.
If the coders prefer, they can support these new tasks and if they do, they will earn points.
